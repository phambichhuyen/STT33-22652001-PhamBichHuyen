                <p id="p1">Back for another year, every night, the Sunny Acres Corn Maze becomes 
                    the Sunny Acres Haunted Maze. This season's maze begins with an encounter with 
                    an evil organist (played by the Council Bluff Choir's own Glenn Frye). Explore 
                    the maze and find the zombie graveyard, the pumpkin tower, and a haunted house 
                    made of corn, not to mention the spiders, ghosts, witches, and other assorted 
                    villainy that inhabit the maze. 
                </p>
                <p>The Haunted Maze is open the last three weekends of October with a special event 
                    on Halloween. Come early in the day to explore the larger Corn Maze, stay for a 
                    homemade meal of brats and burgers, soda, and chips, and then participate in the 
                    Halloween Festival. Special stations will be set up in the Haunted Maze for trick-or-treaters. 
                    A smaller maze is also available that is "scare-friendly" for younger children.
